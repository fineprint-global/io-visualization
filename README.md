# io-visualization
A set of tools that allow for interactive visualization of input-output tables.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive web visualization for input-output tables using R and PostgreSQL.

## Implementation & Infrastructure

As of right now there are two components, an R Shiny web application and a PostgreSQL Database (more specifically a postgis one). The network of those two components can be created with one single docker-compose command.
