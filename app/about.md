# About

This Input-Output Visualization Tool was developed within the <a href="https://fineprint.global" target="_blank">FINEPRINT</a> project. Its **purpose** is threefold:

1. Enable anyone to use and make use of normally complex Input-Output models, no matter the scientific or technical background by providing a <a href="https://github.com/fineprint-global/io-visualization" target="_blank">visualization tool</a> that can be adapted to fit any input-output model. It breaks down the storage-intensive matrices to small pieces of data that can be easily retrieved from a database.
2. As a sample implementation, the <a href="https://github.com/fineprint-global/fabio-hybrid" target="_blank">hybrid FABIO model</a> was used to create this **FABIO Viewer**, which means it provides an easy way to get an overview of hybrid FABIO's capabilities.
3. Its implementation using Docker containers allows to be used and further developed by anyone without a need to install dependencies, no matter the operating system.
